<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello, All. My name is Liz and I am an aspiring website designer and developer.
  Currently, I am learning coding and website development from online resources, including Udemy, with the mentorship of my husband.
  The world of programming and development once intimidated me, but with some motivation
  and courage, I've taken the leap to learn something new.
  My journey so far has been inspiring and exciting, and I aim to reach my full potential.
</p>

<p>My background consists of a degree in business management. My passions include drawing, painting, and reading about the world
  through biographies, non-fiction, and the endlessly satisfying sci-fi sagas.
  With website design, I am able to express my creative abilities as well as test
  my current technical skills.
</p>

<p>I currently live in the Houston area with my small family, including my loving and patient huband, and our 
  energetic four-year-old son. I strive to create beautiful things and beautiful 
  memories. I love the idea of a career path that requires constant learning with 
  endless possibilities. If you would like to join me on this journey, please reach
  out and let's make something great together.
